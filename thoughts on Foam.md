# Thoughts on Foam

## day 1

It's still in it's early days, but so far I like it.

The writing experience is fantastic. I love working with raw Markdown files in VS Code rather than dealing a clunky web app GUI.

I don't love how the notes look when published to GitHub Pages (I'm not doing anything special here, just publishing the raw .md files). The reason you'll see some [square brackets] when one note links to another is because of the way that [backlinking](https://foambubble.github.io/foam/backlinking) is implemented in the tool, which relies on a wiki-links style.

In the future I might add a small build step in between writing and publishing that strips out the brackets (just need to replace the wiki-link style with a standard markdown link). I'd _like_ the content of the site to not expose unnecessary information about how it was composed, but for now, it will do. I am trying to just **write more** rather than constantly yak-shaving/bikeshedding.

## a little while later

Yeah, Foam isn't for me. I don't know which extension in the suite of recommended extensions is the one that does this, but it absolutely kills the performance of VS Code. The fans go nuts on my Mac and the editor slows down to the point where the writing experience is laggy â€” and really, the writing experience in the editor is really all I care about.

I do have one thing to thank Foam for though. It got me writing and publishing my notes in a way more lo-fi way than I've allowed myself to do before. It just gave me that small push to get going again, and to ship to GitHub Pages without being bikeshedding about my site's design.
