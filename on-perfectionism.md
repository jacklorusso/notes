# On perfectionism

_May 3, 2017_

Yesterday marked over 10 years since Mark Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, began producing a piece of art from scratch each day in a project that he called [‘Everydays’](https://www.beeple-crap.com/everydays). In his own words:

> The purpose of this project is to help me get better at different things. By posting the results online, I’m “less” likely to throw down a big pile of ass-shit even though most of the time I still do because I suck ass.

It’s staggering to compare Winkelmann’s scratchy drawings from 2007 to his stunning Cinema 4D work of the past few years. Deep down we know that even our heroes were beginners once, but sometimes it takes a powerful reminder like this to put things in perspective.

Most creative people struggle with perfectionism. I know I do. This post took me far too long to write.

While it’s well understood that perfectionism is the enemy of productivity, it’s perhaps less recognised that perfectionism actually stops you from learning. Experts agree that we learn best from doing – and perfectionism holds us back from doing, whether it’s through fear of the blank page, or getting stuck in the weeds instead of just getting shit done.

I’ve got hundreds of half-baked ideas, sketches and side projects, and almost as many excuses for why they don’t exist yet. Maybe you’re the same.

Let’s do this better. Focus on learning and putting something out there everyday, even it’s small. The big projects will become smaller as you work on your craft.

Whenever self-doubt creeps in, look at Beeple’s early drawings. We all start somewhere.
