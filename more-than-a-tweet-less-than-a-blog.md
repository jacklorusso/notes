# More than a tweet, less than a blog

Frequently I have an idea that I want to tease out and expand on, either to figure out where I really stand on it or to bounce it off some other people and see what they think about it.

Usually I turn to [Twitter](https://twitter.com/lol_russo), but there are many times where I haven't yet distilled my thinking on a subject down to a short and punchy tweet, so I end up writing a whole thread.

Unfortunately, Twitter threads aren't a great writing or sharing medium. Thoughts get unnaturally cut up and segmented. People will retweet, quote or reply to individual segments, losing the context of the rest of the thread and splintering any discussion that follows.

There are times when I think I should write a blog post, but in the past I've fallen prey to crippling [perfectionism](on-perfectionism.md) — I wouldn't want to post a blog unless it was really well thought-out, with a neat structure and a tidy conclusion that _really makes you think_ (lol). I also just haven't been able to post anything without being really proud of the visual design, leading to constant bikeshedding where I work on the design of the blog more than I actually sit down and blog.

These notes are meant to be somewhere in between a tweet and a really polished article. Some notes, like this one, might even closely resemble a blog, but others are only the size of a couple of tweets, or the equivalent of a scratchy note on a napkin. The site is intentionally lo-fi and minimalist, taking away all of my excuses and enouraging me to just write and share freely.

The best thing about this creative freedom that I've finally allowed myself? I don't even need to think of a conclusion to this post. Peace ✌️
