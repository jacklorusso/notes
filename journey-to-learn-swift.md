# Journey to learn Swift

As [SwiftUI](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/) has matured as a technology, my desire to experiment with writing native apps has grown. Big love to the web, always and forever — but maybe it’s time to try something new. I definitely like the idea of working on [[side-projects]] in a completely different programming paradigm.
