# On side projects

Every developer I've ever met knows the feeling of having a graveyard of abandoned side projects. Starting something is easy. Finishing things is hard.

I consider a side project or experiment successful when:

- I learn a new tool, technology, approach or architecture
    -   Need to be careful though. Too much learning means that the whole project is about learning these things and nothing actually gets done.
- I get to flex my design skills
- There is something sitting there at the end with my name on it - not necessarily a 'portfolio' piece that I'm *super* proud of, but something I can point to and talk about with friends or colleagues

Sometimes I achieve only one of these â€” that's still a success in my books.
