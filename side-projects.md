# Side projects

Every creative person knows the feeling of having a graveyard of abandoned side projects. Starting something is easy. Finishing things is hard.

After beating myself up enough times for not finishing my side projects, I decided to reframe the way I think about them. I now consider a side project or experiment successful when:

- I learn a new tool, technology, approach or architecture. If possible, I try not to learn too many things at the same time, otherwise nothing gets done. Sometimes that's simply not possible, like in my current [journey to learn swift](journey-to-learn-swift.md) — because of the project's very nature, almost **everything** is new to me.
- I get to flex my design skills. My day job as a software engineer is rewarding in many ways, but the design decisions I make are usually _very_ low-level.
- There is _something_ sitting there at the end — it might not be finished, it's not necessarily a 'portfolio piece' that I'm super proud of, but there is at least something I can point to and talk about with friends or colleagues, or pick up again later on when it next takes my fancy.

Sometimes I achieve only one of these, sometimes I achieve all three.
