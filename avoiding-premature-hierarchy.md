# Avoiding premature hierarchy

Something that I've learnt over time is that it's usually best to keep information architecture as simple as possible for as long as possible.

If you're in a position where you need to spend a long time trying to figure out where to put something, you're going to spend at least as long trying to find it next time you need it. If you're collaborating with others, it's even more noticeable.

I like to keep things as flat as I can. Only add another layer when I know that I absolutely need it, and always be intentional about it.

This applies for directory structures in codebases, URL design, but also in personal computing organisation, , even the way you organise your apps on the home screen of your phone.
